= Local mode

Commodore provides a local mode for the `compile` command. Local mode is
intended for local development, and won't fetch information from the
SYNventory API or clone Git repositories for the inventory and components.


Local mode can be enabled with the `--local` flag of the `compile` command.

[source,bash]
--
poetry run commodore compile <cluster-id> --local
--

In local mode, the existing directory structure in the working directory is
used. This allows local development on components and also allows testing
local modifications to the inventory. The user is responsible for ensuring
that all the moving parts are where they should be. It's recommended to run
Commodore in regular mode once to fetch all the inputs which are required to
compile the catalog for the selected cluster.

[source,bash]
--
poetry run commodore compile <cluster-id>
--
